# Web Frontend – Group Project Interface

## 📝 Overview
This web application serves as the **user-facing interface** of our group project, allowing users to:

- View project introduction and terms
- Submit anonymous posts
- Browse all submitted content
- Interact with a backend (Supabase) connected to a Raspberry Pi e-ink display

Built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**, this frontend integrates smoothly with our hardware prototype.
